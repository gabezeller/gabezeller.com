                    <p>
                    I actively participate in the Illinois chapter of Triangle Fraternity, a unique organization that 
                    brings together STEM majors. I have held numerous positions in the Chapter, but most notably I 
                    served two terms as Social Director, an elected executive board position responsible for planning 
                    social events for the chapter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    In this position, I managed a $10,000 budget, led a team of 7 social coordinators, and focused 
                    on the overall success of the chapter in addition to my specific duties. The work was fulfilling, 
                    and I even introduced new events for my chapter. The most exciting was a live music house show where
                     we raised ~$900 for RACES, a local charity that provides counseling and support for victims of sexual assault.

                        I am a member of Project Code, an organization that brings together students
                        to build various coding projects. I am currently on a team builing an e-commerce website
                        for students to buy and sell academic materials. So far, we have developed the front-end
                        and now we are developing the back-end.

                        Previously, I worked in a group develop a mobile app to showcase events around the UIUC
                        campus. The app, Illini Happenings, was never pushed to completion by the project manager,
                        but it was still a fun learning experience. More detailed information can be found on the projects page.

                        In the summer of 2024, I worked as GIS Intern for the Peoria County Government IT Department.
                        As a GIS intern, I updated and created various feature layers often used for web applications,
                        worked with the Peoria County Emergency Management Agency to vizualize risk from hazardous 
                        chemical facilities, and developed or fixed multiple Python scripts to automate vital department work.

                    I am a lover of live music, and I frequently attend local shows both in my hometown of Peoria and in the 
                    Champaign-Urbana area. I especially enjoy it when there is a mosh pit! In general, I enjoy most music, 
                    but my favorite is most genres of metal. Currently, I love listening to Slipknot, Deftones, Knocked Loose, and Lorna Shore.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In addition to my love for music, I also find joy in longboarding, especially around campus, exploring fashion through thrifting, 
                    spending time outdoors, and playing pool â€” even though I am not very good.
